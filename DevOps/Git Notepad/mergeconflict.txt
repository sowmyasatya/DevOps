to resolve merge conflict 


merge conflict happens when more than one developer working on same file

eg : 
if person1 who is working on file1 has updated and pushed the file

In the same time person2 is working on the non-updated file1 and updated it 
and trying to push the file1 

then it fails to push the file 

*** then type ->  git pull 
              
then you will get the updated file and along with your modified code in that 
file ...if you want person1 updation only then you have a choice to delete your 
updated line and then 

add/commit/push successfully
